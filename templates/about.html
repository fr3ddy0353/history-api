        <h2>Hi, I'm Frederick!</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a 13-year-old developer passionate about history and technology. I built History Explorer to make learning about major historical events and wars easier, more accessible, and actually fun for students and teachers.
        </p>
        <p>
          This platform pulls live data from Wikipedia and presents it in a clean, easy-to-use format. Whether you're studying for a test or just curious about the past, History Explorer is here to help.
        </p>
        <p>
          I plan to keep adding new content, features, and design improvements over time. If you have suggestions or ideas, I’d love to hear from you!
        </p>
        <p>
          You can explore events, toggle dark mode, and use it on mobile or desktop — all free and open to everyone.
